            There are requirements and complications one has to prepare prior
            to the lodgment of a visa application. If you are planning to
            travel, then it is best to mark up your calendar for your travel
            dates and Visit us for your Visa application at least 3 months
            beforehand to know your Visa requirements and apply for your visa
            in a timely manner. It is always recommended to arrange the Visa
            lodgment appointment at least 14 days prior to your lodgment. When
            applying for the visa you should bear in mind that you are
            submitting documents with reason for travel and showcase your
